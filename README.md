## How-To 
This package is very simple to use. All I did was prepare some scripts and prefabs and make them ready to use. You can separate this package in 3 essential parts:

1. Scripts
2. Prefabs
3. Samples

**Scripts** are a set of common functions like apply a button animation when its have focus or not.

**Prefabs** Some common prefabs like a Canvas ready to be dragged in GvrMain's Main Camera.

**Samples** are prefabs that needed more items to work correctly, like a waypoint movement that need Event System, Waypoint prefab, Scripts and so on. Think on it like Scene encapsulated in a prefab.
