If you are using the legacy GVRMain rather than the new GvrViewerMain (I'm doing this because I have stereoscopic images I need to cull for Left/Right Eyes) in GVR1.1 then you need to add the GVRpointerManager to the GvrMain

ALSO, you need to add the GvrPointerPhysicsRaycaster to the mainCamera, not the unity Raycaster for it to work.
